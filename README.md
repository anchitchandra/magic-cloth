# magic-cloth
This is simple project on see -through cloth . 
**OVERVIEW**:
>Though its not actully see through but is record the enviorment in first 30 seconds the when ever the perticular colour is shown in front of the camera the at that specific place it will over lay the mask of the recoring **both the current video and the recorded video is over laying each other its just removes the pixels of the coloured area with the recoreded video**.
>Based on this concept many codes are already avilable but i mode is way more optimised than you found on other platforms. :)
